# Problem 263 - An Engineers' Dream Come True

This project focuses on Project Eulerâ€™s Problem 263, titled **An Engineers' Dream Come True**. The problem involves practical numbers and specific pairs of prime numbers.

A number is called a *practical number* if every number from 1 up to and including that number can be expressed as a sum of distinct divisors of it. A pair of consecutive prime numbers with a difference of six is called a *sexy pair* (since "sex" is the Latin word for "six"). The problem defines a special sequence of numbers, an "engineers' paradise," which includes three consecutive sexy prime pairs and a set of practical numbers around them.

This project aims to find the sum of the first four engineers' paradises.
I have not yet found a complete solution to the problem.
